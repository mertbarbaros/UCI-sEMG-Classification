# UCI-sEMG-Classification
sEMG classification project based on UCI Dataset


## Project Scope

In this project, I will compare different machine learning classification and deep learning algorithms on UCI sEMG dataset. You can access to dataset via project folder or from UCI website (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EMG+data+for+gestures).

So far we completed the following algorithms:

Machine Learning:

- KNN Classifier
